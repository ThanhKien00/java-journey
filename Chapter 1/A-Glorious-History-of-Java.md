# A Glorious History of Java

## Beginning of the Story üìö

In June 1991, a small team of engineers at Sun Microsystems, led by James Gosling, initiated the Green Project, aimed at
creating a new programming language for consumer electronic devices, such as smart TVs, set-top boxes, and handheld
controllers.

The language was originally called Greentalk with the file extension `.gt`, but was later renamed Oak, inspired by an
oak tree outside Gosling's office. Oak was influenced by several other languages, such as C, C++, Smalltalk, Lisp, and
Ada. However, it wasn‚Äôt initially designed for the web, which was becoming a new platform for distributed computing and
information sharing.

## The Rise of Java üöÄ

In 1993, the Green team showcased their technology to Time Warner for interactive TV, but the cable industry wasn't
ready, so the deal failed. The team then shifted their focus to the web, which offered a more promising opportunity for
their language.

They developed a prototype browser called WebRunner, later renamed HotJava, to execute Oak applets embedded in HTML. Oak
was renamed to Java due to trademark issues. The name Java was chosen because it was simple, unique, fun to say, and
evoked the coffee the team consumed during long hours.

In 1995, Sun Microsystems announced Java at SunWorld conference, and Netscape Communications agreed to include Java
support in their popular Netscape Navigator browser, boosting Java's popularity. Time magazine listed Java as one of the
Ten Best Products of 1995.

## What? Java is evolving!!! üê£

Since its first release in 1995, Java has evolved significantly. In 1998, Sun Microsystems introduced the Java Community
Process (JCP) to involve other companies in the development and standardization of Java. The JCP manages Java
specifications, which define the language's syntax, semantics, libraries and APIs.

- JDK 1.0: _January 23, 1996_. It included fundamental features such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism,
  exception handling, threading, and garbage collection. It also provided core libraries for I/O, networking, graphics,
  and user interface components. The first stable version, JDK 1.0.2, is called Java 1.
- JDK 1.1: _February 19, 1997_. This release of Java more than doubled the size of the Java platform. It introduced
  "**Inner Classes**" and the first version of the **Reflection API**.
- J2SE 1.2: _December 8, 1998; Codename: Playground_. This release was rebranded retrospectively Java 2, and the version
  named "J2SE" (Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition) replaced JDK to distinguish the base platform from J2EE (Java 2
  Platform, Enterprise Edition) and J2ME (Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition). This was a very significant release of Java
  as it tripled the size of the Java platform to 1520 classes in 59 packages. This release marked the first appearance
  of the **Java Collections API**.
- J2SE 1.3: _May 8, 2000; Code name: Kestrel_. This was primarily a maintenance release, focused on bug fixed,
  stability, and performance improvements. This release also brought in the HotSpot JVM, which is still in use in
  today (although heavily modified and improved since then). Java 1.3 is the last release of Java to officially support
  Microsoft Windows 95.
- J2SE 1.4: _February 6, 2002; Codename: Merlin_. This was another fairly big release, adding important new
  functionality
  such as a higher-performance, low-level I/O API; regular expressions for text handling; XML and XSLT libraries; SSL
  support; a logging API; and cryptography support.
- Java SE 5: _September 30, 2004; Codename: Tiger_. This large release of Java introduced a number of changes to the
  core language itself, including **generic types**, **enumerated types**, **annotations**, **varargs methods**,
  **Autoboxing**, and a new `for` loop. This release included 3562 classes and interfaces in 166 packages. Notable
  additions included utilities for concurrent programming, a remote management framework, and classes for the remote
  management and instrumentation of the JVM itself.
- Java SE 6: _December 11, 2006; Codename: Mustang_. This release was also largely a maintenance and performance
  release. It introduced the Compiler API, expanded the usage and scope of annotations, and provided bindings to allow
  scripting languages to interoperate with Java. There were also a large number of internal bug fixes and improvements
  to the JVM and the Swing GUI technology.
- Java SE 7: _July 28, 2011; Codename: Dolphin_. The first Java release under Oracle, it introduced significant upgrades
  to the language and platform, making the first release based on the Open Source reference implementation. Features
  like try-with-resources, I/O handling and the NIO.2 API making code safer and less error-prone. The Method Handles API
  offered a simpler, safer alternative to reflection and enabled the invokedynamic bytecode.
- Java SE 8: _March 18, 2014; LTS Version_. Th√≠s was a huge release, potentially the most significant changes to the
  language since Java 5. The introduction of **Lambda Expression** provided the ability to enhance the productivity of
  developers, the Collections were updated to make use of lambdas, and the machinery required to achieve this marked a
  fundamental change in Java's approach to object orientation. Other major updates include a new **Date and Time API**
  and major updates to the concurrency libraries.
- Java SE 9: _September 21, 2017_. Significant delays, this release introduced platform modularity, enabling Java
  applications to be packaged into deployment units and modularizing the runtime. Additional updates included a new
  default garbage collection algorithm, a process-handling API, and changes to how frameworks access internals. This
  release also shifted the Java release cycle to produce new versions every 6 months, though only Long-Term Support 
  (LTS) releases have gained widespread adoption. From this point, only LTS releases are noted.
