# A Glorious History of Java

## Beginning of the Story üìö

In June 1991, a small team of engineers at Sun Microsystems, led by James Gosling, initiated the Green Project, aimed at
creating a new programming language for consumer electronic devices, such as smart TVs, set-top boxes, and handheld
controllers.

The language was originally called Greentalk with the file extension `.gt`, but was later renamed Oak, inspired by an
oak tree outside Gosling's office. Oak was influenced by several other languages, such as C, C++, Smalltalk, Lisp, and
Ada. However, it wasn‚Äôt initially designed for the web, which was becoming a new platform for distributed computing and
information sharing.

## The Rise of Java üöÄ

In 1993, the Green team showcased their technology to Time Warner for interactive TV, but the cable industry wasn't
ready, so the deal failed. The team then shifted their focus to the web, which offered a more promising opportunity for
their language.

They developed a prototype browser called WebRunner, later renamed HotJava, to execute Oak applets embedded in HTML. Oak
was renamed to Java due to trademark issues. The name Java was chosen because it was simple, unique, fun to say, and
evoked the coffee the team consumed during long hours.

In 1995, Sun Microsystems announced Java at SunWorld conference, and Netscape Communications agreed to include Java
support in their popular Netscape Navigator browser, boosting Java's popularity. Time magazine listed Java as one of the
Ten Best Products of 1995.

## What? Java is evolving!!! üê£

Since its first release in 1995, Java has evolved significantly. In 1998, Sun Microsystems introduced the Java Community
Process (JCP) to involve other companies in the development and standardization of Java. The JCP manages Java
specifications, which define the language's syntax, semantics, libraries and APIs.

## Is there a future for Java?

Although Java has been a veteran in software development since 1996, lots of people still have questioned its future.
Companies that have invested a lot in Java are worried because they don't know what will happen next. And you, a new guy
want to join the game, also concern yourself with many criticisms of Java. Is Java already digging its grave to heaven?

Due to early performance issues and a verbose coding style, Java was perceived as a slow and outdated language. Yet it
is worth delving into these misconceptions and learning how Java has evolved into a fully modern technology.

### Ways Java Performance Beat Misconceptions

Java applications have been criticized for their longer startup times and slower performance than compiled languages.
This is due to the nature of the JVM, as an interpreter of Java bytecode, which often leads to a lag startup time and
performance. Currently, two initiatives are speeding up the startup time of Java applications:

- **GraalVM** speeds up startups, boosts runtime performance, and lowers memory usage of applications based on JVM.
  Therefore, it raises the appeal of Java for high-performance computing with ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation.
- **Project Leyden** aims to solve the startup time issue by introducing a consistent approach for static images in the
  Java platform. These static images begin quicker and use less memory, similar to the languages that compile to machine
  code.

Additionally, snapshot-based approaches are being explored to further optimize startup times. Snapshots allow Java
applications to resume from a saved state, avoiding the need to start from scratch:

- **Project CraC** proposes adding checkpoint/restore functionality to the JVM. This enables programs to resume
  execution from a previously saved state, significantly speeding up startup.
- Cloud platforms like **AWS Lambda‚Äôs Snap Start** leverage snapshots to launch Java applications in the cloud. By
  starting Lambda functions from a pre-saved state, Snap Start drastically reduces startup latency for serverless Java
  applications.

### Efficient Java Concurrency

Java's thread-based model was complex and less efficient for concurrent programming. This was especially noticeable
compared to the simpler, more efficient models offered by languages like Go. **Project Loom** is a new response to the
old need for better handling of many tasks simultaneously. It introduces Virtual Threads (these are like lightweight
thread), looked after by the JVM. With this approach, the system can manage lots of tasks happening at the same time,
even reaching millions.

### Modern Java Garbage Collection

Java's Garbage Collection, while automatic, has historically been prone to "stop-the-world" pauses, making it an
unsuitable platform for interactive systems and causing problems for systems that require stable, low-latency.

New Garbage Collectors, such as **Shenandoah** and **ZGC**, have been introduced in Java, which aim to reduce pauses by
performing most of their garbage collecting work concurrently with Java threads.

### Improved Java Memory

Java applications typically consume more memory for several reasons, including the additional memory required by the
garbage collector to function and the inherent overhead associated with Java objects.

Initiatives like **Project Lilliput** and **Project Valhalla** aim to minimizing object memory overhead and introducing
value types, making Java applications more memory-efficient.

üëâ In conclusion, Java and its ecosystem continue to be pivotal for contemporary business success. Java remains the first
choice for creating enterprise applications, despite the availability of other frameworks. It's time for you to pick up
some idea and make it come true with Java ‚ú®.
